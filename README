A RESTFUL server for creating, managing, running and joining tabletop game sessions. This will be updated as the API is built out.

This server provides a REST interface for creating table top game sessions that include the following
a Game Master
users
player characters (possibly more/less than users)
maps
player locations on maps
non-player units on the map

examples:

Create an account
PUT http://server.com/8000/account/user=JoeTheRogue&pass=FooBar
response: 
	header: 200, Account Creation Successful
	body: true

Creating a new map
PUT http://server.com:8000/map/__MAP-UUID__?user=JoeTheRogue&token=UUID&filename=@/thisMap.jog
response: id=_UUID_

There is a lot of functionality not built out yet including:
sessions that players can join
tagging, collecting maps
real time messaging between players in a session
adding player locations on the map
adding units
modifying anything
support for keeping track of player initiative / restricting movement on the board
