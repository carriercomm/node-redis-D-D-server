A RESTFUL server for creating, managing, running and joining tabletop game sessions. This will be updated as the API is built out.

This server provides a REST interface for creating table top game sessions that include the following
a Game Master
users
player characters (possibly more/less than users)
maps
player locations on maps
non-player units on the map

Getting Started:
So you'd like to run this? You'll need 
node.js (http://github.com/ry/node)
npm (curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh)
and some npm modules
	npm install grasshopper
	npm install redis
	
and if you want the Talk functionality, you'll want to be running os x (for now. In the future the server itself will not talk).

examples:

Create an account
PUT http://server.com/8080/account/user=JoeTheRogue&pass=FooBar
response: 
	header: 200, Account Creation Successful
	body: true

Creating a new map
PUT http://server.com:8080/map/__MAP-UUID__?user=JoeTheRogue&token=UUID&filename=@/thisMap.jog
response: id=_UUID_

Make the server talk:
POST http://server.com:8080/talk?message=helloWorld
response: Hear anything yet?
(server should execute the `say` command on os x)

There is a lot of functionality not built out yet including:
sessions that players can join
tagging, collecting maps
real time messaging between players in a session
adding player locations on the map
adding units
modifying anything
support for keeping track of player initiative / restricting movement on the board
